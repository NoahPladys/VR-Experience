## 4 - ML Agents Deel I
First look at machine learning and training an agent.
Project contains an agent with rays for eyes, which looks for a target on a platform.
The agent gets rewarded for colliding with the target, and gets penalised for falling off the platform.

## 5 - ML Agents Deel II
Second machine learning project.
Agent spawns on the left side of a platform, and has to look around and go over to it's target. After colliding, it has to return to the left side of the platform.
The agent gets rewarded for colliding with the target, and once again for returning to the left side of the platform. It gets penelised when falling off the platform.

## 6 - ML Agents Deel III
Third and final machine learning project of this course.
Agent spawns on a platform where logs start rolling in it's direction. The agent has rays, and the ability to jump.
The agent gets points for jumping over each log, but gets penelised for every extra jump and for failing to jump over a log.
